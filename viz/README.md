# EDA & Insights

- `viz/match-level-eda.ipynb`  
  Quantifies Home Team Advantage & identifies draw rates & scoreline structures.

- `viz/table-level-eda.ipynb`  
  Generates a league table, creating a "dynamic" league that examines:  
  - Form of the top 6 teams  
  - Form in the last 5 games for the top 3 teams (currently, can be altered)  
  This helps explain the presence of momentum in the league.

  Recognizes and analyzes disparities between placed bets and actual results.

- `mle.py` is a `.py` file copy of `match-level-eda.ipynb`.
